/**
 * Takes a `minimum` and `maximum` and returns a boolean if `source` number
 * is between them.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const between0 = numberBetween(0);
 * const between0And10 = between0(10);
 *
 * between0And10(5); // 5 because is inside the range (0-10).
 * between0And10(-1); // 0 because it was lower than the minimum (0).
 * between0And10(11); // 10 because it was higher than the maximum (10).
 * ```
 * @param minimum Minimum boundary.
 * @returns Curried function with `minimum` in context.
